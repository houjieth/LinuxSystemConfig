1. install thinkfan package
3. load kernel module 'coretemp'
4. add the following three sensor entries to /etc/thinkfan.conf just before the temperature levels:

sensor /sys/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon0/temp1_input
sensor /sys/devices/virtual/hwmon/hwmon0/temp2_input

5. add the following to /etc/modprobe.d/thinkfan.conf:

options thinkpad_acpi fan_control=1

6. reload kernel module 'thinkpad_acpi'
7. set START="yes" in /etc/default/thinkfan
8. start thinkfan: /etc/init.d/thinkfan start

9. check whether it works: cat /proc/acpi/ibm/fan

if level has a value between 0 and 7, and changes by times, your thinkfan daemon works.
